Made a commitment today to stay in my current role and continue learning web development afterhours for the next 4-5 months. I believe that should be enough time to land my first role at another company. I'm committing myself to learning web development during that time as my sole focus. I want a career where I'm building things, always learning,  solving real problems, and not confined to a particular location. 

I also want to try my hand at freelancing within the next few months. Finding people who have business problems that need to be solved and that I can help through software development would be perfect! i don't even need to make money from it, just having the experience of helping other people using new skills is enough encouragement to continue along the path.

Web development and programming in general seems like the best fit for that. It feels like i'm drinking from a firehose but I kinda love it! I love the fact that things are always evolving and that theirs more to learn. Most importantley, I like the fact that I can see how what I want to work on would be useful.
