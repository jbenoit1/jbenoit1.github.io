<p>Hello! Welcome to my blog. This is my place on the internet to document my learnings and thoughts.
</p>

<p>A little background on me. I currently work full time as an Environmental Engineer in the manufacturing sector. I assist my companies sales team through preparing proposals and working with other engineering departments. This blog will not be about this at all.</p>

<p>What i'm most interested in now is learning to code, learning to build products that people are interested in, and learning how to find customers. I have some programming experience and love learning about it. I wanted a bplace to document my learnings online. I don't expect that I'll have my own paying business for a while but documenting the journey is important to me. If you're interested in following along, sign up for my newsletter below for new annoucements on any products I launch and new blog posts.</p>
