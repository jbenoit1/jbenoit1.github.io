I saw a tweet by @levelsio on twitter about adding your Github contributions calendar to your website.

I really like that idea! Showing that you are working regulary in public encoruages personal accountability to keep doing the work (at least for me). Even knowing that no one is likely reading this blog, the fact that it's public and people CAN read it encourages me to keep putting in the work.

I added it to my about page. I also added it below:

I want to transition into software engineering/development. This path is one that's notorious for people giving up along the way. The more accountability I can instill to make sure I'm putting in the work the better.

While i think it's cool to see all the commits I make to github, I should mention that I don't think  this is the best indicator of progress. While time spent practicing coding may be a good indicator of improving your skills, it's really what you are learning through doing that matters. Watching your 11th HTML tutorial without working on building a website or a web app isn't going to move me towards my goals. The best indicator is the projects I'm building and putting out into the world.

Today, I bought a few of Brad Traversy's courses on Udemy. I like his free content on Youtube ([Brad's Youtube Channe;] and having his video courses walk you through a few of the key concepts in more detail will provide me with more structure that I think will help me progress quicker on this path. My plan is for the next couple weeks to go through his HTML/CSS Course and build out and modify a few of the websites 

I also want to see if I can find someone in my network who could use a website, build one for them, and deploy it online.. I think learning through doing and helping others is the best method.
