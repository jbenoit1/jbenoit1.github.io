Made a commitment today to stay in my current role and continue learning web development afterhours for the next 4-5 months. I'm committing myself to learning web development during that time as my sole focus. I want a career where I'm building things, always learning,  solving real problems, and not confined to a particular location. 

Web development and programming in general seems like the best fit for that. It feels like i'm drinking from a firehose but I kinda love it! I love the fact that things are always evolving and that theirs more to learn. Most importantley, I like the fact that I can see how what I want to work on would be useful.
