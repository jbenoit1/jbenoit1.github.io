I just found this [post](https://zerotomastery.io/blog/learn-to-code-in-2021-get-hired-and-have-fun-along-the-way/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=learn-to-code-2018) online for an 80/20 path to becoming a developer in 5 months.

I love the thought process behind deconstructing the goal and finding out the most effective and efficient path to acheiving it. Andrei shares tons of great resources I hadn't seen before.

Not sure if this path was meant for someone working a full time job. We'll assume it is and just put in the work. ðŸ™‚

This is a path I'm going to follow. 5 Months from today is September 20, 2021. My target will be end of October for becoming a full time software developer.
